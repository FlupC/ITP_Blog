# Kinetic

## Faraday Spray Can

I was looking through all of the kinetic energy conversion mechanisms and I was having a lot of issues with thinking of pieces with rotational energy. I just didn't have a lot of ideas. So, when I read about the faraday light, it was like a ~lightbulb~ went off. 

So, I began to think of things that we shake often (i.e. sodas, spray cans, etc). When spray can popped into my head, I thought about how I could do that with electricity in some interesting way. Here is my idea:

To push this idea further, I would like to store energy in a smaller capacitor (I want you to need to shake often). I could also see if there are ways to change colors on the UV sensitive paper (just not sure).

# Measurement

## Shower Head

My shower head is INTENSE. So, I'd like to know how much energy I can get from it. I think I can 3D print some blades that will rotate from the water pressure, then use insulated wires to grab the output and measure it with a multimeter.
