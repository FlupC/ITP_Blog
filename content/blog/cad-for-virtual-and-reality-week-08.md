So, I decided to try and make something with some natural curves. I struggled a decent amount with the modeling.

Essentially, moving one face up would mess up another vertex, which would then screw up the height. It was a bit of a headache. BUT! I think it turned out OK.

I then used simple cylinders, angled them, then used the join function to add it together.
