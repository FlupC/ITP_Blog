# Generative Desk

`vimeo: https://vimeo.com/534183022`

For this assignment I wanted to make some desks using the generative design function.

Admittedly, this wasn't a huge process. The main thing that happened is I tried to cancel the output partway through because I wanted to adjust the parameters, but I don't think it ever canceled and so the outputs were on my old version, but they looked quite nice! I am happy with this overall. I also included the weirdest output I got, which I assume is hollow.
