# Extrusion

This is the extrusion that I chose to design

There are some oddities about this. I assumed it was in mm, but 1.8mm thickness is bizarre. I should have done the entire piece in cm, but scaling it up by a factor of 10 should fix it overall, so no biggie.

I also misread 1 measurement and the tiny notch is .5mm instead of 1mm, not a huge deal.

# Works in Progress

These are my WIP pictures. I did have to restart at one point because things got shifted in a weird way that I never understood. 

Additionally, there was some weirdness with the move tool. Sometimes, there was no dialogue that let me move or copy.

My best friend was the pivot tool, so I was able to copy move and rotate the edges according to the middle axis point. That said, you can only copy and move edges (not faces), so I couldn't copy after a certain point. Is this possible to change?
