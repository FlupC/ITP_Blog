# Solar Project:

## Update 3 (Week12): CAD Draft, Housing Solar Panel

Before I go into what I have done, I need to go through what I still need to do:
1. Wireless communication between arduinos (Bluetooth? WiFi?)
2. LED control using the light data
3. Fabricate the piece.

The two main things I have done this week are build a housing for my solar circuit and draft the first iteration of the grow light enclosure. The housing is just about finished, but I am waiting for my standoffs to arrive in the mail. They should arrive tomorrow.

Then, I drafted the grow light. This will be done as a prototype build. I am finishing the CAD on it this week so it can be cut by a local shop and back in my hands ASAP.

This still has 3 more things to figure out:
1. Widen the ring width to accomodate more soil
2. How does the acrylic fit into the frame
3. carve out area for arduino nano


## Update 2 (Week11): Finished Solar Circuit

This week I was able to set up my solar circuit. The arduino can be powered for a long period of time with just about 2 hours of GOOD sunlight. The solar charger works, and I have set up a light sensor that works, but I need to find a new one.

This one isn't sensitive enough. It will basically be at max with a little bit of light, and 0 with not too much light. As such, it is just going to give all or nothing to the LEDs, making it nearly impossible for this to work. I cannot currently find anything that will work, I have already reached out to my cohort's discord.

I have photos of all of this, but I got dumped the other day and am emotionally exhausted. I promise I will update them here when I'm feeling a little better.

## Update 1 (week10) : Slight Adjustments and Bill of Materials

For this first update for this project is that I want to take it in a different direction. I decided to talk to some of my friends who do not have windows. They loved the idea of having a small plant that blooms by opening and closing, but said they'd rather just have real plants. 

I still want to make the piece with a sun-reactive plant, but in the interest of usability and time, I want to adjust it slightly. Nothing will be changing on the solar front, but I am going to use it to control a grow light instead. I would like to design the grow light housing so its quite nice and sleek, so it should still be nice looking.

Usually, you are not supposed to dim your grow lights, but you are also not supposed to keep them on all day. This piece will adjust the total light output (adjusted to be always at a useful level) based on the light outside. 

### Bill of Materials

I am sorry this is in flux, I have some questions about batteries and keeping the system safe.
