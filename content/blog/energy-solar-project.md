# Solar Project:

## Update 1 (week10) : Slight Adjustments and Bill of Materials

For this first update for this project is that I want to take it in a different direction. I decided to talk to some of my friends who do not have windows. They loved the idea of having a small plant that blooms by opening and closing, but said they'd rather just have real plants. 

I still want to make the piece with a sun-reactive plant, but in the interest of usability and time, I want to adjust it slightly. Nothing will be changing on the solar front, but I am going to use it to control a grow light instead. I would like to design the grow light housing so its quite nice and sleek, so it should still be nice looking.

Usually, you are not supposed to dim your grow lights, but you are also not supposed to keep them on all day. This piece will adjust the total light output (adjusted to be always at a useful level) based on the light outside. 

### Bill of Materials

I am sorry this is in flux, I have some questions about batteries and keeping the system safe.
