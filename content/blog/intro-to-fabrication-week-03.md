# Cat Bowl Holder

So, this week I wanted to attempt to create a 3D geometry. I started by trying to make this: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B011TZVE40/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

I bought the one made of half circles, but when I looked closer, there appeared to be a bunch of very small angles and etc. that would not be able to be recreated in a laser cutter.

So, I decided to try and make a cat food holder like this: https://www.amazon.com/YHY-Ceramic-Raised-Ounces-Elevated/dp/B07S7P3MFS/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=cat+food+holder&qid=1618363960&sr=8-3

First, I looked up some dimensions and determined some basic lengths. I also added a bunch of holes and connectors for it to slide together.

Next, I got a few 12 x 12 wooden squares.

I was able to upload everything to the machine and cut pretty easily. There were some issues with the actual size of the wood. It appears to be a little less than 12 x 12 and I cut off the cut a little bit. I ran it again after moving the shape, but it was somehow worse. Nevertheless I decided it was largely unnoticeable and I glued both halves together.

The next piece required that I glue the support beam between the two legs for the stand. I should have made it so the support was at the bottom and I would be able to use an angle clamp to hold it together. I tried a few ways to hold the piece level, but ultimately had to use hot glue.

And voila!
