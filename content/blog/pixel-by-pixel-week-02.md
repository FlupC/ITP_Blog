# Processing Sketch 01

This week we were asked to somehow put ourselves into a sketch. Whether its by nationality, personality trait, etc, but we have to use shapes and basic transformations.

i actually found this really challenging for 2 reasons. The first is that I have been doing object oriented coding for a long time and the Java syntax confused me, so I had to just use the draw loop. The second is that I struggled to put myself on a page. 

This week has been pretty crazy for a lot of reasons and I keep feeling like my brain is flexing and struggling to focus on one thing at a time. That is how I got to the following sketch.

I basically wanted these "neurons" (though that does feel like it is too lofty a word for this work) to have function and form, but are difficult to focus on or pause with your eyes. Like a crowded mind.

I am pretty happy with the result, I used a sin function to change the radius/diameter of the circles, then attached the colors to a y value and a changing x value (according to a constrained mouseX).
