# 2 Player Hook and Ring Game

For this week, I tried to make something simple. A ring toss game, which can be seen [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/979966074/ring-toss-game-handmade-wooden-table?gpla=1&gao=1&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_us_b-toys_and_games-games_and_puzzles-board_games-other&utm_custom1=_k_CjwKCAjwj6SEBhAOEiwAvFRuKCKSgt9pg0wm31tsVodEMu22zrZEJ2o8rVBYCCK8hpA0vXMZtTRHFRoCLVMQAvD_BwE_k_&utm_content=go_1844178614_68548286606_346429831802_aud-1184785539738%3Apla-314262775187_c__979966074_12768591&utm_custom2=1844178614&gclid=CjwKCAjwj6SEBhAOEiwAvFRuKCKSgt9pg0wm31tsVodEMu22zrZEJ2o8rVBYCCK8hpA0vXMZtTRHFRoCLVMQAvD_BwE&variation0=1911546860).


These were all the materials I had on hand, so I decided to use a cork base and then a wood dowel/plank combo.

I measured everything according to the example above, and marked centers on my cork and my wood

Then I took to the drill press and used a forstner bit to make the holes. Unfortunately, they were a tad too big (even though I used the "correct" size, I probably should have used a caliper).

Because of this error, I had to drill the rod into the top, which ended up causing a screw to break. I cut off the excess and sanded it down to the best of my ability.

After that, I got hooks, added them to the frame, then managed to break one of only 2 hook screws available at my hardware store in the right size. I eventually got smaller ones, but they just do not work as well.

So, from here, despite the disasters so far, I added rubber feet and added everything together.

You'll notice excess string. Because of the size of the screws, I am unable to get the right length of rope pinned down. Because of this, I don't want to tie the lock knots and send it home. 

This whole project was a mess and I am very frustrated by it. I should have been a little more careful with the forstner bits, then everything would have slid together and been less of a challenge. I think this is fun anyways, so I will remake it from scratch over the summer!
