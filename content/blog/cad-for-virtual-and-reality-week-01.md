# Wooden Block
When considering the front of the object, I was a little confused. I knew that the overall shape was better shown with the flat side with the indent, but the more nuanced parts of the shape are on the thinner piece.

Nonetheless, I decided that the front would be the flat part, and the side is the more nuanced piece. Also, I am not an artist, but I thin my orthographic view was pretty decent.
