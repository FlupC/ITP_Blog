# CNC Applications

Part of the reason I took this class was to be able to make something in virtual space and bring it to life. 

So, for this assignment, I am going to use what we have learned about CAM and Fusion to bring to life a project for another class: a custom grow light. 

I will be using a machinable cork and plastic to make a grow light that is in a ring shape that can have LEDs, the wires, and an Arduino housed within it. 

For this class, the main deliverable will be the CNC CAM work, but I am hopeful to reach out to Ben and get a tutorial on making it a reality.
